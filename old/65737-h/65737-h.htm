<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;LIGHT HO, SIR!&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> people who are always striving to
trace back to a man&#8217;s early training or surroundings
the real reason for any startling change in
his life after he has long grown up, and do not
believe in what the Bible calls the New Birth,
must often be sorely puzzled. They seek for
that which they wish to find, and often ignore
any evidence which militates against their preconceived
theories. Yet the majority of them
would be horrified were they told that this
method of research is dishonest and misleading.</p>

<p>But in spite of what people may feel about
the matter, it is of no use blinking the fact that
very much of the so-called scientific investigation
(which is not commercial) that is pursued
to-day is tainted with this radical defect.
Especially is this so in matters of inquiry into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
religious experience. There are many exceedingly
clever and well-educated persons who
would have their readers believe that in all
cases where a man or woman has become a
Christian, and from serving the devil has turned
and consistently served God, the change has
been due to early impressions, which, accidentally
encrusted over for a term, have been suddenly
revived in all their pristine force, and
have compelled the mind back into the channels
in which it was originally taught to move.</p>

<p>Now, if this were all that these reasoners said,
one might remind them, or inform them gently,
that they were only partially right&mdash;that while
it is undoubtedly blessedly true that early influences
for good do exert themselves most
forcefully and unexpectedly in after years in a
large number of cases, yet it is most untrue and
God-dishonoring to suggest that Christianity is
purely a matter of education, of environment,
of a long acquaintance with religious persons
and matters. So far from this being the case,
it is a truism with Christian workers that very
frequently their most hopeful converts have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
been those who never heard the Gospel before,
or at least had never listened to it with the
slightest attention, even though they may have
actually caught the tones of the preacher&#8217;s voice.
To such simple ones the Water of the Word of
Grace comes like the monsoon rains upon the
burnt-up breadths of India, causing the apparently
dead soil to put on at once a glorious garment
of living green, life-giving, life-sustaining,
beautifying and blessing all around it.</p>

<p>One of the most striking instances of this
wonderful work of God in the soul that has ever
come under my notice is that of a sailor who,
strange as it may seem to-day, had never, until
the time of which I speak, received the remotest
idea of the relations of God to man, and had not
the faintest conception of religion of any kind.
Born in the squalid slums of a Lancashire town
nearly sixty years ago, he became at a very early
age a waif of the streets, losing all recollection
of who were his parents, as they had forgotten
all about him. It is hardly possible to conceive
of a mind more perfectly desert than was John
Wilson&#8217;s. Reading and writing were of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
out of the question, and it is probable that any
mental operations that went on in his dark mind
were more nearly related to brute instincts than
to any of the ordinary processes of human reasoning.</p>

<p>Now it is no part of my present plan, even if
I had the necessary material, to trace Johnny&#8217;s
career from the gutters of &mdash;&mdash; until he found
himself in the position of boy on board a North
Country collier brig, being then, as he supposed,
about thirteen years of age. By some inherited
tenacity of constitution he had survived those
years of starvation, cold, and brutality, and was,
upon going to sea, like a well-seasoned rattan,
without an ounce of superfluous flesh upon him,
and with a capacity for stolid endurance almost
equalling a Seminole Indian.</p>

<p>Of kindness he knew nothing, and had any
one shown him any disinterested attention, he
would have been as alarmed as are the birds in a
London garden when a lover of them goes out
to scatter crumbs. He would have suspected
designs upon his liberty, or something worse.
Of the treatment he endured on board those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
East Coast colliers I do not dare to speak at
present. The recital would, I know, arouse an
almost frantic feeling of resentment that such
things should have been possible such a handful
of years ago, and readers would forget that, by
the blessing of God, men&#8217;s hearts to-day, even in
the lowest strata of our society, have been marvellously
softened towards children. He learned
many things on board those ships, he told me,
but, so far as he knew, not one that was good.
Blasphemy, drunkenness, cruelty, debauchery&mdash;all
these he became an adept in as he grew up,
and besides he knew every conceivable trick by
means of which he could shirk duty and shift it
on to the shoulders of others.</p>

<p>At last he reached the dignity of able seaman,
but I can bear witness that a less useful
able seaman than he never darkened the door
of a shipping office. And why? Because he
had devoted all his low animal cunning to the
avoidance of learning anything, lest he should
be compelled to put it into practice, at the cost
of some trouble to himself; and what he was
compelled to know he purposely practised as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
badly as possible, so that he should seldom be
called upon to do it. Briefly, and in order to
put the finishing touches to this unattractive
picture, he was almost as perfect a specimen of
unmoral animal as any course of training for the
purpose of producing such an undesirable human
being could have resulted in.</p>

<p>In this manner he passed the years of his life
up to the age of thirty, drifting, like a derelict
log, from ship to ship, and from shore to shore,
all round the world. He was conversant with
the interiors of most of the seaport jails in the
world, for when under the influence of drink
he was a madman, only to be restrained from
doing deeds of violence by force, and utterly
careless of the consequences of any of his actions.
At last, in the course of his wanderings,
he came to Calcutta, and was enticed by a shipmate
up to the Sailors&#8217; Rest in the Radha Bazaar
one Sunday evening, when he had neither money
nor credit wherewith to get drink. His shipmate
was a Christian of very brief experience,
but he had the root of the matter in him, and
knew that the next best thing to preaching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Gospel one&#8217;s self was to bring one&#8217;s friends in
contact with some one who could. So it came
about that Harry Carter, finding Johnny wandering
about the bazaars aimlessly and hungrily,
proposed a feed to him, and by that means got
him into the Rest, where, after his hunger was
appeased, Harry succeeded in keeping him until
the evening meeting.</p>

<p>At that time the meetings were conducted by
two American missionaries to whom it was a
perfect delight to listen, as they told in quaint
language, loved and comprehended by sailors,
the wonderful story of the coming of Jesus to
save poor fallen man. Theirs was not preaching
in a general way&mdash;every man in their presence
felt that he was being individually conversed
with, felt that the story of the Cross was a simple
narration of absolute fact, no mere theory of mysterious
import, which only men and women who
were specially selected and educated for the purpose
could ever hope to understand. They told
the wonderful tale in manly fashion, letting the
God-given message just flow through them on
its way from their Father to their brethren.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>And Johnny sat with eyes astare and mouth
agape, as the straight, brave, certain words sank
into his awakening mind. Wonder, incredulity,
shame&mdash;all struggled within him, all newly born,
for it could hardly be said with truth that he
had ever realized any of these emotions before.</p>

<p>At last the speaker said: &#8220;Oh, my dear boys,
some of you here have never known what it is to
have a friend, yet there has been a Friend by
your side always, only begging you to be a friend
of His. Some of you have never had a home,
yet this Friend has been for nearly two thousand
years preparing a home for you that is beyond
all your hopes, beyond everything that you can
imagine. Some of you have never in your lives
had any real joy; this Friend has in His right
hand for you pleasures for evermore, and in His
presence there is fulness of joy. He can and
will do for you exceeding abundantly above all
that you ask or think. All these wonderful
privileges may be yours for the taking; you
haven&#8217;t even to ask for them&mdash;only say that
you will accept them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other sweet words followed, but Johnny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
hardly heard them. In his dark soul there was
such a turmoil as he had never before known.
New needs, new desires were struggling for expression,
and when the preacher dismissed his
congregation with the earnest invitation for any
to remain behind who felt they would like to
know more about this wonderful gift, Johnny
sat still in his place with wide, starting eyes
following every movement of the preacher.</p>

<p>At last that good man, passing from bench to
bench, came to Johnny, and at once saw that
here was no ordinary seeker after peace. Laying
one arm tenderly across Johnny&#8217;s bowed shoulders,
and with the other hand taking one of
the seaman&#8217;s gnarled and knotted hands, the
missionary said, &#8220;Brother, let Him have you.
He wants you to be happy, He does want your
love. Jesus, gentle Jesus, died for you that you
might be happy with Him for all eternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a vehemence that was startling Johnny
turned and said, &#8220;Does He know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, better than you do,&#8221; said the preacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;And He&#8217;s got all these things for me? I&#8217;ll
work all the rest o&#8217; th&#8217; voy&#8217;ge but what I&#8217;ll have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
this&mdash;I don&#8217;t care what it costs me, I&#8217;ll have
it. You see if I don&#8217;t. I know now it&#8217;s what I
been wantin&#8217; all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, my dear brother,&#8221; said the preacher,
&#8220;you can&#8217;t buy it. He bought it with His blood
to give it to you, and you can&#8217;t pay anything
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never had anythink give me in my
life,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;&#8217;T ain&#8217;t right. Everythink&#8217;s
got ter be paid for, and I&#8217;m going ter pay for
this. I&#8217;m no beggar, if I am a bit of a thief when
I gets the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, strange as it may seem, the hardest task
that man of God had on that occasion was to
convince this poor white savage that the gift of
God <i>was</i> a gift. Gladly, joyfully, would he have
sold himself into a long slavery to have purchased
what he felt he must have, yet for a long time
he would not, could not, believe that it was &#8220;without
money and without price.&#8221; At last despairingly
he said: &#8220;Oh! won&#8217;t He take a shillin&#8217;
for it? I got one in my chest, a lucky shillin&#8217;
with a hole in it I&#8217;ve had for years. Let me go
aboard an&#8217; get it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>At last, with great difficulty, he was convinced
that buying salvation was impossible, but impressed
with the fact that he himself was from
henceforth bought with a price, even the precious
blood of the Son of God. And while the weary
evangelist was still toiling to explain, the Lord
took the matter in His own hands. And presently
a joyful shout burst from Johnny&#8217;s lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Light ho, sir! I sees it all. He&#8217;s got me,
an&#8217; He&#8217;ll never let me go. Oh! why didn&#8217;t I
know of this afore?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a saved man. Let those argue who
will, dispute who can, Johnny Wilson was a
standing proof of the power of God to save
the most ignorant, the most callous of the sons
of men. From that day forward, without any
more teaching, save what he could get from any
one who would read the Gospels to him, he grew
in grace. He was no more trouble aboard. His
work was always done to the best of his ability,
and you could safely trust him to work by himself,
for, as he said: &#8220;My Jesus is alonger me
alwus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, but he was a real saint! Nothing could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
move him. He used to be hated by everybody&mdash;now
he became the spoiled child of the fo&#8217;c&#8217;stle,
at least in intent, for really he was unspoilable;
but all hands, no matter what they thought, conspired
to love Johnny. And when on the subsequent
voyage he died of a blow received in
falling from aloft, all hands gathered round his
bunk, to hear from him the story that had transformed
his life. He gushed it out with his latest
breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus Christ, God&#8217;s Son, come down from
heaven to look for me an&#8217; make me happy. I
wasn&#8217;t worth a rope-yarn to anybody, but He
come and found me, an&#8217; made me so glad. An&#8217;
now I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; ter see Him. Dear Jesus
Christ, the friend of pore devils like me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="ph1">A SAILOR&#8217;S CONVERSION.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sitting</span> upon the capstan in the centre of the
fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le-head of a huge four-masted ship rushing
swiftly along the wide, wild stretch of the
Southern Ocean, bound to England round Cape
Horn, a young able seaman in the prime of life
was engaged in the unusual mental exercise
for seamen of meditating upon God. His name
does not matter; it must be sufficient to say
that he was brought up in a respectable middle-class
home in the north of England, one of a
family of seven,&mdash;four boys and three girls. He
had been christened at the parish church, attended
Sunday-school and family prayers with
the utmost regularity, and had been confirmed
at an early age. In spite of occasional outbreaks
of wildness, he had won prizes for exemplary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
conduct at Sunday-school, and had felt,
with the mistaken idea of so many, when he received
them, as if somebody were trying to
bribe him to give up all the fun in life and
become a strait-laced, long-visaged humbug.
But he also felt, thank God! that in his life
there were two solid facts that could never be
explained away, standing up like bastions of
native rock in his life,&mdash;the love of his mother
and the kindness of his father.</p>

<p>All that he heard in church and Sunday-school
was readily relegated by him to the category
of things that ought to be done, even if
you couldn&#8217;t see the use of them; but as to
trying to understand them, well, that was the
merest nonsense. Not that he ever put these
thoughts and feelings into words, but they were
none the less real to him.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, without any previous preparation
discernible by him, a foreign element
came into his life. Coming home from the
village school one afternoon (he was then thirteen
years old), he met a bronzed, weather-beaten
man who inquired of him the way to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
neighboring town; and as that way for some
little distance happened to be his own, they
walked together. Within ten minutes the boy
had imbibed from the wayfarer an intense desire
to go a-roving. For the weather-beaten
stranger was a sailor returning home after an
absence of many years; and the plain recital of
his adventures, without any attempt to enhance
their interest, fired the country boy&#8217;s blood to
such an extent that his breath came in short
gasps, and he gazed at the seamed and sunburnt
face beside him as if he could see in it some
reflection of the wondrous scenes through which
it had passed apparently unheeding. They
parted; but the boy, his brain all in a ferment
with wonder and desire, returned to his home
as one that treads the clouds. And that night
he waylaid his father, saying stammeringly:
&#8220;Dad, I want to go to sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the father, although a home-keeping man,
had long faced the probability of losing his nestlings
as soon as they felt their wings growing,
the more since he knew well that opportunities
for their attaining any position worth considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
in the small town of their birth would almost
certainly be wanting. Moreover, he had a severe
struggle to keep them in comfort on his very
small though constant earnings, and any lightening
of his burden, even though in the process
his heart-strings were strained, was to be welcomed.
But as each child had been born to him
he had commended it unreservedly to the care
of his Heavenly Father, whose love to him had
been the pivot of his own life ever since he was
sixteen years old. And so it came about that,
after a touching scene with his mother, the boy
was helped to his desire, and by the most heroic
efforts on the part of his father he found himself,
six months after giving utterance to his
wish, a member of the apprentice portion of the
crew of a huge four-masted ship, bound from
Liverpool to San Francisco.</p>

<p>His first month at sea was a revelation to the
country-bred lad. In place of the home hedged
in by love, into which the foulnesses so prevalent
in great cities never penetrated, he found himself
met at every point by profanity and worse.
In place of having all his bodily needs cared for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
all the decencies of life made easy for him, he
was left to his own ignorant devices, and all the
dreadful consequences of being his own master
in his own time descended upon him without
warning. The captain was a careless, callous
man, who only looked upon the apprentices as
an inefficient supplement to a scanty crew. And
while he worked them mercilessly in consequence,
he found it no part of his duty to look
after the welfare of either their bodies or their
souls.</p>

<p>Under this treatment the boy soon became a
finished young blackguard in thought, and so
soon as the opportunity arrived to put the evil
theories he had so readily absorbed into practice,
he flung himself into all forms of evil within his
reach with a recklessness and zest that were horrible
to contemplate. Finally, he ran away from
his ship in company with an older apprentice,
breaking his indentures, and cutting off definitely
the last hold his home had upon him.</p>

<p>A wild time of sin, suffering, and sorrow followed.
Yes, sorrow; although, in the same
Spartan fashion practised by so many thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of wanderers like himself, he concealed it under
an assumption of utter indifference, utter godlessness.
At last, when in the throes of a prolonged
debauch he was staggering along one of
the lowest streets in Callao, he was seized by a
gang of predatory ruffians, beaten out of what
little sense he had left, and conveyed on board an
American ship bound thence to England. This
is the process called by seamen &#8220;Shanghai-ing.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be impossible to convey to people
living sheltered lives on shore how terrible
were the physical sufferings of the poor lad
now, bruised from head to heel, shaking from
illness brought on by his excesses, yet compelled
to toil in superhuman fashion under pain of
being savagely beaten again. But he felt no
repentance, he only cursed his &#8220;luck,&#8221; and
dumbly endured, as seamen do. Then one
night, during the keeping of his lookout, one
of his watchmates whom he had hitherto despised
as a mild, say-nothing-to-nobody sort of
a duffer, came quietly up on to the forecastle
head, and, standing near him, gazed steadfastly
out upon the loneliness of the midnight ocean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
for some time saying not a word. The full
moon had just emerged from a dense black
cloud, driving before her, apparently, the darkness
that had so recently reigned, and paling
the lustrous stars with her glorious radiance,
while every tiny wavelet rippling the peaceful
sea became instantly edged with molten silver.
And the influence of the hour, amid all the
eternal immensity of the environment, made
for breathless awe, silent involuntary worship
of the unseen yet palpably present God.</p>

<p>Suddenly the new-comer spoke quietly, yet
with a certain force, as if unable to hold his
peace any longer. &#8220;Jemmy, lad, don&#8217;t ye feel
as if we was a-sailing inter the very presence of
Almighty God&mdash;as if He wanted t&#8217; show men
&#8217;at won&#8217;t think, how glorious He is, an&#8217; how
great is His peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply, but as the speaker paused
to look for the effect of his words, he saw
glittering in the moon-ray two big drops stealing
down Jemmy&#8217;s sorrow-seamed young face.</p>

<p>Immediately the Christian, following his
Master&#8217;s example, took a quick stride to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
youth, and laying his hand upon the trembling
shoulder, said softly: &#8220;Dear boy, let &#8217;em run.
They&#8217;re a sign that your heart ain&#8217;t got too
hard yet to feel the sweet influence that God
puts out to win His wandering ones back. But
if there&#8217;s anything I can do to help you, do let
me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came nearer as he spoke, until his arm
was round Jemmy&#8217;s neck. And then he waited
patiently until the broken words came: &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;feel
so miserable. I&#8217;ve forgotten my mother
and father, my home and my God. But p&#8217;raps
I never knew Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear boy, I don&#8217;t suppose you ever did;
but now is your time to know Him. He&#8217;s been
waiting for your proud heart to bend down and
own that it wants Him&mdash;can&#8217;t do without
Him. Oh, Jemmy, how He loves you! Your
mother and father love you, and are heartbroken
over you, no doubt, but He, your Father
God, loves you from everlasting to everlasting,
and spared not His own Son, that you might be
made welcome to His peace, that you might
know how happy a child of God can be who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
has found out from God Himself how much He
is longed and waited for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker paused for breath, for his energetic
outburst had so carried him away that
he was like a man who had been running a
race, and as he did so Jemmy said shyly, and in
a low voice: &#8220;How did you know that I was
wishing with all my heart that in some way,
somehow, I might get my soul put right, that I
was longin&#8217; for a message from God, without
any idea how it was to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a happy ring in the Christian&#8217;s
voice as he answered: &#8220;Me know? I don&#8217;t know
anything, except that God the Father is my
Father, that God the Son is my Saviour, who
died that I might live, and that God the Holy
Ghost, whose work it is to impress these wonderful
matters on men&#8217;s hearts, is always at hand
arranging the time, the messenger, and the message.
He found me as He finds you&mdash;hopeless,
heart-sick, hungry for peace and love; and as
soon as He made me feel my need of Him He
had some one there to tell me the glad story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then and there Jemmy slid down to his knees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and lifting his streaming face to heaven he murmured,
&#8220;O God my Father, forgive me my sins,
and make me what I ought to be. Dear Jesus,
put your own precious life into me and drive the
unclean life out. I do believe in you, my
Saviour, because you compel me to by your
love. Teach me your way&mdash;I&#8217;ll make it mine.
Bless my poor father and mother at home, and
let me get back and comfort them; and bless this
dear brother here who you&#8217;ve made use of to
tell me, for Christ&#8217;s sake. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deep and solemn was the response from his
new-found friend kneeling beside him. As they
rose from their knees Jemmy reached for his hand,
and clasping it in both of his own, said brokenly,
&#8220;How real and true all comes back to me now,
what I heard when I was a little chap at home
and at Sunday-school! How can I ever thank
God enough for sending you to me? But how
silly I must have been not to see it before!
Oh, thank God, thank God I see it now! God
my Father waiting for me, Christ my Saviour
knocking at my heart, and the Comforter sending
you into this place, on to this fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le-head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
at the right minute to give me the right
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight bells&#8221; rang out clearly from the tiny
bell aft, and as Jemmy hastened to strike the
big bell responsively he murmured: &#8220;Thank
God my night watch is over&mdash;the morning has
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thenceforward he and his brother in the Lord
were inseparable, whenever it was possible for
them to enjoy the communion they both needed.
Their heavy tasks on board remained really the
same, but they did not feel them. They worked
cheerfully as unto God, upheld by His wonderful
sustaining power, and everything around
and about them seemed changed for the better.</p>

<p>So it is when, after long buffeting the gale that
is blowing fair for home, because the captain is
uncertain of his position and dares not run before
it, the pilot comes on board, orders the helm
to be put up, and the good ship fleeing homeward
with a fair wind seems to have suddenly
sprung into fine weather. Jesus, the Heavenly
Pilot, comes on board of a man and takes charge,
bringing light for darkness, joy for misery, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
embracing all these, the peace of God which
passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>Night after night found Jemmy as we found
him at the beginning of this story, day after day
saw him sturdily and more deeply digging into
the treasure of the Word, until that blessed day
when with his beloved chum at his side he burst
into the old home, to receive that welcome that
only a loving mother and father can give to a
son restored to them by God&#8217;s mercy in answer
to many prayers.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
